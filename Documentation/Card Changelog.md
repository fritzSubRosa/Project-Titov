# Action Cards
## C1: Tax Collection

## C2: Conscription

## C3: Levy Infantry

## C4: Public Rituals

## C5: Political Maneuvering
- B: renamed to Political Maneuvering to better reflect the nature of Influence as a resource. 
  
  Wording rephrased of secondary ability to : "Spend X Influence: Perform X of the following, choosing each option only once."

## C11: Hill Country Conscription
- C: Added the "Statecraft" subtype. It makes sense that one would be able to Corvee this card, representing a more direct impressment / payment of taxes in kind.

## C20: Seditious Priests
- A: Removed the "Ma'at" subtype. This subtype should refer primarily to things that gain the player stability, not that are simply related loosely to stability as a concept. 
  
  Retained effect changed to "Disrupt 2". This reinforces the connection of the priesthood/Moon Priests specifically to card draw and deck manipulation. Intensifying crises is moved over to the Influence slice of the colour pie.

## C39: Wheel-Turner Diplomats
- A: Changed cost from 1 Food to 2 Influence. Mechanically it makes more sense that you are cowing these people into submission with your political cachet to get them to go out in the world and treat on your behalf. 
  
  Added new ability: "Delay 1, Twice" as an OR before the main ability. In general I think the bimodal cards are the most interesting ones so far, and this is a reasonable additional reason to choose this card if it no longer serves as an easy source of Influence. Also justifies the increased cost.

## C41: Naval Patrol
- A: Removed the clause relating to playing "Trade" cards since those have been removed from the Action Deck and moved to the Objective Deck.
  
  Added Scout 1. Influence / naval cards are generally going to have to do with manipulating the Objective Deck. 
  
  Added flavour text: "Give us four of those casks you ‘don’t have’ and we’ll agree that you ‘don’t have’ the other forty.”

## C44: Heralds of the Sun
- A: Name changed from "Sun King's Heralds" to "Heralds of the Sun" to future-proof it, since I think these should survive the death of the Sun King. 
  
  Added flavour text: "We bring a universal dawn." Thematic and also a reference to *Mahashmashana* by Father John Misty, which I've been listening to a lot lately while I work. 
  
  Base Might output reduced by 1, Stability gain replaced by a mode to gain 1 Might. No longer strictly better than Conscription, but now much more flexible.
