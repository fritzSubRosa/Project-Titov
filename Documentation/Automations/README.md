# Card Generator 


- Needs Python 3 installed. 

**Generating the templates:**
- If you have python installed in your system (windows) double click on the `py` file and it will generate all the templates. 
- On macOS, run this through the terminal. I'm not writing how to do that here. Ask me directly or google it. 

**Editing the structure:**
- To edit the structure of the template, open the `py` file in a text editor (ideally visual studio code, unless you have your own preference)
- Edit the `CARD_STRUCTURE` in there 
- If you run into trouble let me know. 
- Python uses blank spaces (blank space, tabs, etc.) as part of the file structure, so be mindful of the spaces and indents or the script may crash. Hence, use vscode, that will take care of spaces for you. 

**Future direction:**
- This file is only useful right now when the structure is not well defined and we need to change file structures in bulk. 
- Once we have a sophisticated enough structure, we will need a new script that can edit existing files instead of overwriting them.
