# Questions 

## MSA: 
1. How many cards in the hand at one time?
	1. Answer: There is no maximum hand limit at present. The player draws a default of 5 cards at the start of every Action Phase. This amount can be increased permanently (eg. M3 "Gather a Coalition" dilemma choice) or temporarily (eg. completing O18 - "Conduct Census")
2. In `O49`, what is flashpoint and sisters? is that a new subtype?
	1. Answer: These are subtypes, relating to the Storm-Followers and Four Sisters, two potential ally/rival factions. Cards representing their diplomatic or military assistance can be added to the player's deck. Certain Objectives also have these subtypes, but N.B. Objectives are not considered "Controlled" (which refers exclusively to cards in the player's Action Deck, Hand, or Action Discard)
3. `M01` has a circular arrow as part of its effects, does that mean repeats every 3 turns? 
	1. Answer: Correct. The circular arrow symbol (should appear on all milestones, an oversight) means that the timer resets. Milestones are never lost until they are resolved.
