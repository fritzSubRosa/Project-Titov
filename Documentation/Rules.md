# Rules
## Game Setup 
Set aside the Resource Tracker cards. Place them face up with 3 cubes of their respective colors (Red for Might, Blue for Stability, Yellow for Influence, and Green for Food). These will henceforth be known as Resources.
- Place card M1 "The Upper Cataracts" face up. Place a d6 on this card set to the number next to the hourglass symbol at the bottom of the card. 
- Place the other Milestone cards (labeled M) in order (M1, then M2, etc.) in a deck face down. This is the Milestone Deck.
- Take the Objective Cards (labeled O) marked with a Diamond symbol, shuffle them, and deal three of them face up to the left of the first Milestone. This is the Agenda. Place any remaining Objectives in a pile face down. This is the Objective Deck. Place the other Objective Cards in a separate pile face down. This is the Objective Supply Deck. For easy reference, do not shuffle this separate pile, as you will periodically add specific cards from this deck into the Objective Deck.
- Take 4 C1 - "Tax Collection", 2 C2 - "Conscription", 3 C4 - "Public Rituals", 1 C5 - "Diplomatic Overtures" and shuffle them together. This is the Action Deck. Draw a hand of five cards. 
- Play can now begin, starting with the first Action Phase.

## Sequence of Play

### Card Specific Terminology
- **Add to Hand**: Add the specified card directly to the player's Hand.
- **Expendable**: Remove this card from play if it is played.
- **Gain "a Card"**: Add the specified card to the Discard Pile of the Deck it belongs to (Action Deck, Objective Deck).
- **Gain to Deck**: Add the specified card to the Deck it belongs to.
- **Retained**: Resolve this effect if the card was not played this turn.
- **Seasonal**: Remove this card from play at the end of this Action Phase if it was not played.
- **Mandatory**: This card must be played at some point during the player's action phase. 
### Action Phase
- Play Action Cards
	- The player selects a card from their hand that they wish to play.
	- The player pays the cost listed in the top-right-hand corner of the card, if any.
	- The player resolves the effects of the card.
	- If the card is Expendable, remove it from play after resolving step 1.c.
- Repeat until the player cannot or chooses not to play any additional Action Cards.
- Resolve any Retained card effects.
	- N.b. Retained card effects can cause a player to lose more resources than they have available. If that is the case, resolve the "Misfortune" section below. 
		- Eg. Hatshepsut has 1 💪Might, 0 🌾Food, and 1 ⚖️Stability by the end of her Action Phase.
		- She has the card "Corruption" (Retained: Lose 1 💪Might, Lose 1 🌾Food, Gain 1 ⚖️Stability) in hand. 
		- She loses 1 💪Might but cannot lose the 1 🌾Food. 
		- She therefore immediately gains a 🌾Food Misfortune card into her discard pile for each 🌾Food she cannot pay - in this case, 1. She then gains 1 ⚖️Stability.
- Remove any Seasonal cards from play.


### Resolution Phase
- Resolve Objectives
	- Choose an active Objective or Milestone
	- Spend resources from their respective banks.
		- A player may not voluntarily spend more resources than they possess.
- If the player spends enough resources to resolve the Milestone or Objective, resolve it with the following:
	- The player gains listed resources, if any.
	- The player gains listed cards, if any.
		- N.B. Unless otherwise noted, cards are gained to their respective discard piles.
- Repeat the above until the player chooses to stop.

### Advance Clocks

- Going from left to right, ⏳ Clocks on all Milestones or Objectives which have not been resolved in Step 1 are decremented by 1. 
	- If this causes the ⏳ Clock of the Milestone or Objective to reach 0, resolve the ❌"Failure" condition indicated on the card.
		- N.B. The involuntary loss of resources brought about by failing an Objective can cause a player's resources to hit 0. Resolve the effects of this deficit immediately before proceeding.
		- If the card is an Objective card and the ❌Failure condition has the ↩️ Return symbol, place the card in the Objective Card Discard pile. Otherwise, remove it from play.
		- If a card has the ♻️ Reset symbol, do not remove it. Instead, reset the ⏳Clock to the amount listed next to the ⏳ Clock
	- Going from left to right, Crises on all Milestones or Objectives which have not been resolved in Step 1 are decremented by 1.
	- Resolve failure as outlined above.

### Reset Phase
- If the active Milestone has been resolved, place it on the bottom of the Milestone deck and replace it with the next card in the deck.
- Set a ⏳Clock for the new Milestone at the indicated start time, if any.
- Set the Crisis to its starting condition, if any.
- For each empty space in the Agenda:
	- Draw a card from the Objective Deck and place it face up in the Agenda.
	- If there are no cards in the Objective Deck, shuffle the Objective Discard Pile and then draw a new card.
- Draw 5 Action Cards
	- N.B. Card effects can increase or decrease this amount.


If there are fewer than 5 Action Cards in the Action Deck, draw as many as possible. Then, shuffle the Discard Pile into the Action Deck and draw cards until you have cards in hand.
