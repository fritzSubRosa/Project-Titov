## Phases 
### Action Phase
The only phase in which the player may play Action Cards, unless otherwise indicated. Progresses as follows.

1. Draw **5** cards 
2. Play card from **hand**, doing the following in order:
	1. **Spend** the **resource** in the top-right hand corner of the card 
	2. If the card is a **Province**, check if the printed inequality is true  
		1. If it is true, resolve the given effect  
		2. If it is not true, resolve the "ELSE" effect  
	3. **Gain resources**, as appropriate
	4. Resolve any additional card effects, as appropriate.  
	5. If there is a **clock** on the card, **advance** it.  
		1. If the **clock** is full, resolve the indicated effect, then empty it.  
	6. If the card is **Expendable**, **destroy** it.
3. Repeat the above steps any number of times until the player chooses to end their **Action Phase**.   
	- N.B. the player may not end their **Action Phase** if they have any **Mandatory** cards in hand. They must play all **Mandatory** cards.  
4. At the end of the **Action Phase**, resolve any **Retained** effects of cards still in **hand**.  
5. Discard all remaining cards in hand.

### Crisis Phase 
1. Spend **resources** from their **banks** to resolve **Objective** or **Milestone Cards** depending on their type.  
	1. *Projects*: **Spend** indicated **resources** to **advance** the **project** the indicated amount. If the **project clock** is full, resolve its effect.  
	2. *Wars/Crises*: **Spend** indicated **resources** to **advance** the **war** the indicated amount. If the **war/crisis clock** is full, resolve its effect.  
	3. *Dilemmas*: **Spend** the indicated **resources** to resolve a given path of a **dilemma** and resolve its effects.   
	    1. Eg. Choosing the "Pay them off" path of "Border Raid" (O36) requires the player to **spend** one **food**. They then **gain** the "Blood Money" **action card** by adding it to their **action discard**. Because the card does not say **return (‚Ü©Ô∏è)**, it is **destroyed**.  
3. If resolving an **Objective** or **Milestone** causes the player to **gain resources**, they may use those **resources** to resolve other **Objectives or Milestones** in the same **Crisis Phase**. (e.g. "Daisy Chaining").   
    1. E.g. If the player with 0 **food** in their **bank** resolves "Raid Beyond the Cataracts" (O11) by **spending** 3 **might**, they instantly **gain** 4 **food**. If "Debt Jubilee" (O7) is currently in the **Agenda**, the player may immediately **spend** 3 of the **food** they just gained to resolve the "Forgive peasant debts" path of "Debt Jubilee."  
4. Once an **Objective** or **Milestone** has been resolved, do the following:   
    1. If the **Objective** path chosen contains the **return (‚Ü©Ô∏è)** keyword, move the **Objective** into the **Objective Discard**, leaving an empty space in the **Agenda**.   
    2. If the **Objective** path chosen does not contain the **return (‚Ü©Ô∏è)** keyword, **destroy** the **Objective** card, leaving an empty space in the **Agenda**.  
    3. If the resolved card was a **Milestone**, place it in the **Milestone Discard**. Do not draw another **Milestone** until the **Reset Phase.**  
5. The player may repeat the above any number of times. Once they no longer wish to continue, they may end their **Crisis Phase**. Proceed to the **Reset Phase**

### Reset Phase 

Do the following, in order:  
  1. **Advance** the **timer** on every **Milestone** and **Objective** that is still in play (i.e. was not resolved during the previous **Crisis Phase**)  
  2. If **advancing** the **timer** on a **Milestone** or **Objective** fills it, do the following:  
	  1. *Milestone*: Resolve the text next to the **timer**. Then, empty the **timer**. Do not remove the **Milestone**. Do not draw an additional **Milestone**. 
	  2. *Objective*: Resolve the text next to the **timer**. If the text says **return** (‚Ü©Ô∏è)  
  3. If there is no active **Milestone**, reveal the top card of the **Milestone Deck**  
  4. Fill each empty space in the **Agenda** by drawing a card off of the **Objective Deck** and placing it face up.   
	  1. If the **Objective Deck** is empty, shuffle the **Objective Discard** and place it face down as a new **Objective Deck**. Then, resume the above. 
  5. Resume play with the next turn's **Action Phase**.
